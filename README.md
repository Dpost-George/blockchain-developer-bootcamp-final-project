Problem: Expats always want to sent presents or gifts back home for many reasons. 
With classical Delivery companies it is not only expensive but time consuming, yes sometimes people want to sent gift or parcels today for a next day receiving (emergencies ?). Somepeople want to buy goods that are not sold in their Countries but only the delivery cost might discourage them and most importantly the time range from Weeks to Months.

Solution + Workflow: 
  - Qdelivery: is an Ethereum Dapp aiming to first address the Problem of quick delivery for expats by expats or any other traveller.
  - Sender: This a Person with something to send, he publishes his intent (with destination ....) and make an offer of what he is willing to pay for. We also think of a very small charge to publish an intent (avoid spams)
  - Traveller: He picks up the item if agreed with the payment but after staking (collateral) to proof his honesty. Once the Item is deliver his stake + delivery cost is release back to his wallet.
  - User will have the possibility to register on the platform and be whitelisted (Advantage of picking parcels without collaterals (less collateral or publishing intent without paying).
  - Some users might chose to go fully anonymous (Just need to use their Addresses with metamask and stake collateral to be able to pick up a Parcels).
 For the bootcamp final project we will like to design and fully implement the smart contract logic.
